## Recommendations for Future Improvements

For teams looking to enhance this project, consider implementing the following security features and improvements:

1. Implement two-factor authentication for user logins.
2. Use prepared statements consistently to prevent SQL injection.
3. Add CSRF tokens to all forms to prevent cross-site request forgery.
4. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
5. Use HTTPS to encrypt all data in transit.
6. Enhance password policies (e.g., complexity requirements, regular password changes).
7. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for more granular permissions.
8. Add an audit log to track all system activities and changes.
9. Implement data encryption for sensitive information stored in the database.
10. Develop a mobile app version for easier attendance logging.
11. Integrate with biometric devices for more accurate attendance tracking.
12. Implement geofencing to ensure employees are at the designated workplace when logging attendance.
13. Add reporting and analytics features for better insights into attendance patterns.
14. Implement a notification system for absence alerts and reminders.
15. Develop an API for integration with other HR systems.

These recommendations will significantly improve the security, functionality, and scalability of the attendance monitoring system.
